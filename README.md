An example that offers ideas on how to get started with a JavaScript-based HTML5 text adventure game.

Working title for your game
"Depths of Despair"

Describe the opening of the game. 
This should include what choices are available to the user at the start of the game (e.g., the "character creation" phase) and what backstory or setup is presented.

To start you wake in a dark cellar in the bottom of a dungeon. You recall you were taken prisoner for taking vegence on the man who killed your wife. For character creation the user will type in a name and pick from one of four professions: Chef, Hunter, Apothecarian, or Blacksmith. 

Describe the setting/world for your game. What kind of environment and locations will the player be in and move through?

The game will take place almost entirely in a dungeon type of location. The player will make its way thru the dungeon and escape out of a sewer into the open world.

List the entities in the game. 
These are the people, monsters, objects, etc. that appear in the game. 
If possible, mention the locations where these entities might be found, and perhaps some additional information regarding how these entities relate to the story and gameplay.

The player will come across guards that will stop them from trying to stop them from escaping. 
There will be various monsters in the dungeon some will aid the player and some will try and trick or destroy them. 
There will also be certain items found throughout the game like posions and food and weapons and depending on the profession you choose you will be able to use these items in different ways.

List the various actions that a user will be able to take in your game.
Not every action must be available at all times in the game - for example, if there is nothing to pick up in a particular room, then the "pickup" or "take" action might not be available.

There will be look actions, take/pick-up, loot, talk, hide, fight, shoot, eat, create and drink.

Describe the endgame scenarios. How, where, and when can the game end? Not every decision is a game-ending decision, and not every location or entity directly relates to the ending of the game... but which are?

End game scenarios would come from either escaping or dieing. There will be several ways to lose health and some ways that you die instantly no matter how much health you had.
